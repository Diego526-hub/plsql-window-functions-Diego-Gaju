## Step 1: Problem Definition
**Business Context:** PopStop is an online popcorn store that delivers quality popcorn to the people's doorsteps.
**Data Challenge:** PopStop faces challenges in indentifying the popcorn flavours that do well across different regions.
**Expected Outcome:** Gain insights on the top perfoming popcorn products, monitor the regional sales well and understand our customer's spending habits.	

## Step 2: Success Criteria

**Top 5 Products per Region/Quarter** 
Top 5 popcorn flavors per region/quarter → Use RANK() to rank sales by amount.

**Running Monthly Sales Totals**  
Running monthly sales totals for each flavor → Use SUM() OVER() for cumulative totals.

 **Month-over-Month Growth**  
 Month-over-month growth in sales for key regions → Use LAG()/LEAD() to calculate percentage changes.
 
 **Customer Quartiles**  
Customer quartiles based on purchase frequency → Use NTILE(4) to divide into loyalty tiers.

**3-Month Moving Average Sales**  
3-month moving averages for sales amounts per product → Use AVG() OVER() with a frame clause.

## Step 3: Database Schema

### SQL Schema Creation
-- Customers table
CREATE TABLE customers (
    customer_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    region VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Products table  
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR2(100),
    category VARCHAR2(50)
);

-- Transactions table
CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id NUMBER PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id NUMBER REFERENCES customers(customer_id),
    product_id NUMBER REFERENCES products(product_id),
    sale_date DATE,
    amount NUMBER
);

### **Step 4: Window Functions Implementation**


## SStep 4: Window Functions Implementation
1. Ranking Functions
Implementation: ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK()

Query Example:

sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, name, region, total_revenue,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as row_num,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as rank
FROM customer_revenues;

<img width="655" height="226" alt="ranking_all_methoda" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85dc981f-994f-4f54-9ec6-986bd04374fa" />

## Aggregate Functions
Implementation: SUM() OVER(), AVG() OVER() with frame clauses

Query Example:

sql
SELECT 
    TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM') as month,
    SUM(amount) as monthly_sales,
    SUM(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM')) as running_total
FROM transactions
GROUP BY TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'YYYY-MM');
Results:

Interpretation: Tracked monthly sales trends with running totals and 3-month moving averages. This helps identify growth patterns and smooth out short-term fluctuations.

## Navigation Functions
Implementation: LAG(), LEAD(), growth percentage calculations

Query Example:

sql
SELECT 
    month, monthly_sales,
    LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month) as prev_month,
    ROUND(((monthly_sales - LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)) / 
     LAG(monthly_sales, 1) OVER (ORDER BY month)) * 100, 2) as growth_pct
FROM monthly_sales;
Results:
https://screenshots/month_over_month_growth.png

Interpretation: LAG and LEAD functions enable period-to-period comparisons. Calculated month-over-month growth percentages to identify seasonal patterns and business performance trends.

## Distribution Functions
Implementation: NTILE(4), CUME_DIST()

Query Example:

sql
SELECT 
    customer_id, name, total_spent,
    NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) as spending_quartile,
    CUME_DIST() OVER (ORDER BY total_spent) as cumulative_distribution
FROM customer_spending;

<img width="650" height="244" alt="customer quatiles" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/170ec057-e540-4b72-8f35-190eec1d408b" />

    SELECT 
        c.customer_id,
        c.name,
        c.region,
        SUM(t.amount) as total_revenue
    FROM customers c
    JOIN transactions t ON c.customer_id = t.customer_id
    GROUP BY c.customer_id, c.name, c.region
## Ranking Functions
**Implementation:** `ROW_NUMBER()`, `RANK()`, `DENSE_RANK()`, `PERCENT_RANK()`

SELECT 
    customer_id,
    name,
    region,
    total_revenue,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as row_num,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as rank,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue DESC) as dense_rank,
    ROUND(PERCENT_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY region ORDER BY total_revenue) * 100, 2) as percent_rank
FROM customer_revenues
ORDER BY region, total_revenue DESC;
<img width="826" height="374" alt="running_all methods" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/30a29e43-459c-40c1-9701-c8499e242d3d" />



Interpretation: NTILE divided customers into 4 equal groups for segmentation, while CUME_DIST showed the cumulative distribution of spending. This enables targeted marketing campaigns based on customer value.

## Step 5: Results Analysis
Descriptive Analysis (What Happened?)
Caramel Crunch emerged as the top-performing product across all regions

Kigali region generated the highest revenue (45% of total sales)

Monthly sales showed consistent growth from January to July 2024

Sweet category products outperformed savory products by 35%

Top 25% of customers (VIP segment) contributed 42% of total revenue

## Diagnostic Analysis (Why?)
Sweet flavors have universal appeal leading to higher sales volume

Kigali's higher population density and purchasing power drive more sales

Seasonal promotions in April contributed to sales spikes

Customer preferences show clear favoritism toward caramel-based products

Consistent month-over-month growth indicates effective marketing strategies

Prescriptive Analysis (What Next?)
Inventory Optimization: Increase stock of Sweet category products, particularly Caramel Crunch

**Regional Expansion**: Focus marketing efforts in North and East regions to balance regional performance

**Customer Loyalty**: Launch VIP program for top quartile customers identified through NTILE(4) segmentation

**Product Development**: Introduce new caramel variant flavors to capitalize on proven customer preferences

**Promotional Strategy**: Time major promotions based on monthly growth patterns identified through LAG() analysis

**Personalized Marketing**: Use customer segmentation to create targeted campaigns for each spending tier
